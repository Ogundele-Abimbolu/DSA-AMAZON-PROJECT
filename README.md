# DATA ANALYSIS AND PREPARATION FOR RETAILTECH INSIGHTS

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive data preparation and analysis undertaken to construct the Amazon dashboard. I aimed to transform raw, disparate datasets into a clean, insightful, and actionable resource for tracking key performance indicators, best-selling products, and identifying market trends. Through meticulous data cleaning and transformation, I ensured the integrity and reliability of the data, providing a robust foundation for the interactive visualisations now available in the dashboard.

## Introduction

Before I could build a useful dashboard, I had to spend a considerable amount of time understanding, cleaning, and preparing my data. This document explains how I took my raw, untouched data and turned it into the clean, well-organised information that makes my Amazon Dashboard work. My main goal was to make sure the data was correct, consistent, and useful, so that everyone looking at the dashboard could easily get clear, fact-based insights.

## Data Sources

The dataset contains information scraped from Amazon product pages, including:
* **Product details: name, category, price, discount, and ratings.**
* **Customer engagement: user reviews, titles, and content.**
* **Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data stored as comma-separated values**
  
## Data Preparation Workflow

My data preparation process involved several key stages to ensure data quality and readiness for analysis:

### 1. Data Collection & Ingestion

I began by securely collecting data from the identified sources. This involved importing Excel files. All data was initially loaded into an Excel spreadsheet to view.

### 2. Data Cleaning

In this crucial stage, I focused on identifying and rectifying data quality issues to ensure accuracy and consistency. Key steps included:

* **I addressed the data cleaning for this dataset by identifying and handling missing values, ensuring correct data types were applied, standardising text entries like product categories, removing any duplicate records, and carefully treating outliers to prepare the data for accurate analysis.**

### 3. Data Validation & Export

Before moving to the dashboard phase, the transformed dataset underwent final validation checks to ensure its integrity and readiness. The cleaned and prepared data were then exported in a suitable format for the dashboarding tool.

* **Final Data Structure:** The final dataset used for the dashboard has 21 rows and 1466 columns, structured to support the planned visualisations.
* **Export Format:** Data was exported as CSV files.

## Conclusion

The rigorous data preparation process described above was fundamental in creating a reliable, accurate, and insightful foundation for the Amazon dashboard. By meticulously cleaning, transforming the raw data, I have provided stakeholders at RetailTech Insights with the powerful data to make informed decisions that can that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.
